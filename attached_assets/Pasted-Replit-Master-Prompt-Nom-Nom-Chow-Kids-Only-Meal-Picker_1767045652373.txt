Replit Master Prompt — Nom Nom Chow (Kids-Only Meal Picker)

Build a production-ready full-stack web app named Nom Nom Chow for parents who want kids-only, headache-free dinners. Domain: nomnomchow.com. The app should be a fast, image-first “pick a meal → get steps + shopping list” experience.

Tech stack (use exactly this)

Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Next.js API routes (server actions OK) + Prisma ORM

Database: SQLite for dev (works in Replit), structured so it can switch to Postgres later

Auth: Simple admin auth using a password in env var (no OAuth for MVP)

AI: OpenAI API for generating the cooking instructions + shopping list (server-side only)

Hosting: Must run with npm run dev in Replit, and also be deployable

Core product requirements (MVP)

This is kids-only. The user does NOT log in.

Public user flow

Home page: simple landing with tagline: “Meals kids actually eat.”

Start screen: parent selects:

Age Range: (2–5, 6–10, 10–13)

Diet filters (optional): none, vegetarian, dairy-free, gluten-free

Cuisine filters (optional): American, Mexican, Italian, Asian, “Any”

Skill level: Easy, Intermediate, Advanced

Time limit: 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 minutes

After selection: show a grid of meal cards with images (use placeholder images initially, stored locally, but structure so meals can have image URLs later).

Click a meal card → Meal Detail page:

Show meal photo, time, skill, cuisine, kid-friendly notes

Button: “Generate instructions” (AI)

When clicked, call server API to generate:

Step-by-step cooking instructions optimized for busy parents

Kid-friendly adjustments + “optional spice for adults at the end”

Substitutions for common missing items

A clean shopping list grouped by: Produce, Meat, Dairy, Pantry, Spices, Frozen

Tool suggestions list (knife, cutting board, thermometer, sheet pan, etc.)

Display AI output nicely with headings and bullet lists

“What’s in my fridge?” feature

Page or section where user enters ingredients (comma separated or tags)

Optional: “must use chicken” toggle

It suggests 3 meals from the existing meal database and lets them generate instructions for any suggestion

If ingredients don’t match anything, generate suggestions using AI but still map to a new “draft meal” object (not stored unless admin approves)

Monetization requirements (must be included)
Amazon Affiliate links

Add a “Recommended Tools” section on the Meal Detail page.

Each tool should have:

name

short 1-line why it helps parents

an Amazon affiliate link placeholder

Store a single environment variable AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG and generate links as:
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=<urlencoded item>&tag=<tag>

Tools to include by default (at least): chef knife, kid-safe knife option, cutting board, instant-read thermometer, sheet pan, nonstick skillet, slow cooker, air fryer, cookbook for picky eaters

Put a small disclosure: “As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.”

Instacart integration (MVP placeholder, but real structure)

Add a “Shop Ingredients” button.

For MVP, it should generate an Instacart search URL using meal ingredients:

https://www.instacart.com/store/s?k=<urlencoded ingredients>

Put the code in a way that can be replaced later with real Instacart affiliate/deep-linking if available.

Admin panel (protected)

Route: /admin

Password login using env var ADMIN_PASSWORD

Admin can:

Create/edit/delete meals

Upload or set image URL

Set tags: cuisine, skill, age ranges, dietary flags, time

Approve “draft meals” created from AI ingredient suggestions (if any)

Admin dashboard shows:

Total meals

Most viewed meals (track views)

Most generated AI recipes (track generations)

Data model (Prisma)

Create Prisma schema including at minimum:

Meal: id, title, description, cuisine, skillLevel, timeMinutes, ageRanges (array or string), dietaryFlags (array), imageUrl, ingredients (array), createdAt, updatedAt

GeneratedRecipe: id, mealId, inputFiltersJson, outputJson (instructions, shoppingList, toolSuggestions), createdAt

MealStats: mealId, views, aiGenerations

DraftMeal (optional): id, title, ingredients, suggestedByIngredients, status (pending/approved/rejected), createdAt

UI requirements (clean, parent-friendly)

Mobile-first design

Large tappable meal cards

Minimal text, big images

Fast loading, no clutter

Use Tailwind with a simple neutral palette

Include a sticky “Back to Meals” button on meal pages

Add a loading state for AI generation (“Generating kid-friendly instructions…”)

Add error handling (rate limit / missing API key)

Security requirements

Never expose OpenAI API key to the client

AI generation must occur server-side only

Basic rate limiting per IP for AI generation (simple in-memory limiter is OK for MVP)

Sanitize inputs

AI prompt behavior (important)

When generating instructions, the AI must:

be concise but detailed

use numbered steps

include timing cues (“5 minutes”, “while that cooks…”)

assume a normal home kitchen

include kid-friendly notes and substitution tips

produce a shopping list grouped by category

produce tool suggestions geared toward parents

Environment variables

Create .env.example and use these:

OPENAI_API_KEY=

ADMIN_PASSWORD=

AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG=nomnomchow-20 (placeholder)

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Nom Nom Chow

Seed data

Include a seed script that inserts at least 24 kid-friendly meals across cuisines and difficulties (but still kid-friendly). Examples: sheet-pan chicken, turkey tacos, spaghetti & meat sauce, quesadillas, baked salmon bites, chicken fried rice, sloppy joes, mini meatballs, etc.
Each meal must have:

title

ingredients list

cuisine, skill, time, age ranges

placeholder image path

Project structure & scripts

Provide clear README with:

how to run

how to set env vars in Replit

how to login to admin

how to reseed database

npm run dev should start the app without errors

Prisma migrations must run cleanly in Replit

Deliverables

Generate the COMPLETE codebase with all files:

Next.js pages/components

API routes for AI generation, meals, admin auth

Prisma schema + migrations + seed

Tailwind setup

README

.env.example

Extra polish (nice-to-have but do it if possible)

Add a “Favorites” feature using localStorage (no user login)

Add a “Weekly Plan” view (client-side) where parents can add meals to Mon–Sun (stored in localStorage)

Add SEO basics (title, meta description)

Now build it.
