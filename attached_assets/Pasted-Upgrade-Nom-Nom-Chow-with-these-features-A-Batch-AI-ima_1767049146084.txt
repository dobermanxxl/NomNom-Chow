Upgrade Nom Nom Chow with these features:

A) Batch AI image generation (Admin only)
1) Add an Admin page section: “Images”
- Show counts: total meals, meals missing images, meals with images.
- Add buttons:
  - “Generate images for all meals missing images”
  - “Regenerate image for selected meals”
  - “Stop batch job”
- Show a progress UI:
  - current meal being processed
  - # completed / total
  - # failed
  - list of failures with retry button

2) Safety and cost control
- Admin-only access enforced with ADMIN_PASSWORD.
- Add rate limiting (e.g. max 30 images/hour) with a friendly message.
- The batch job must throttle requests (e.g. 1 image every 3–5 seconds) and never fire all at once.
- Cache: if a meal already has imageUrl, skip unless “regenerate” is chosen.

3) Image generation prompt (blanket, inferred)
- The image must be photorealistic, home-cooked, weeknight, kid-friendly.
- No restaurant plating, no garnish, no studio lighting.
- Must accurately match the dish using meal.title + meal.ingredients + cuisine/time/skill.
- Must not add random extra foods.

B) Lock aspect ratio & make the grid always look good
1) All meal card images must display as 1:1 square thumbnails, cropped cleanly (object-cover).
2) Generated images must also be stored as 1:1 square to keep consistency.
- If using Cloudinary, apply transformations for square crop (fill, 1024x1024).
- If local storage fallback, crop/resize server-side to 1024x1024 square before saving.
3) Add a default fallback placeholder image if imageUrl is missing so nothing is blank.

C) Add more recipes (kid-friendly)
1) Expand the seed data to at least 80 total meals (add 50+ more).
- Keep them truly kid-friendly and weeknight realistic.
- Cover categories: chicken, beef, turkey, pork, fish, vegetarian, pasta, tacos, rice bowls, sheet-pan, slow-cooker, air-fryer.
- Each meal should include: title, ingredients array, cuisine, skill level, time, age range tags, dietary flags when applicable.
2) Also add an Admin tool: “Add Sample Meals”
- Button that inserts an additional curated set if DB is sparse (avoid duplicates by title).

D) Fix search bar so it actually returns results (e.g., “steak”)
1) Implement a working search experience on the meals list page:
- Search should match across:
  - title
  - ingredients
  - description
  - cuisine
  - tags (dietaryFlags, skillLevel, ageRanges)
- Searching “steak” should return meals with steak in title OR ingredients.
- Add debounced input (300ms).
- Keep filters (age range, cuisine, time, skill) working together with search.

2) Backend/API
- Add an API route like /api/meals?query=&cuisine=&skill=&maxTime=&age=&diet=
- Implement query logic using Prisma:
  - case-insensitive contains matches for title/description
  - ingredient array search (contains) or join/normalized string search
- Return results sorted by relevance:
  - title match first, then ingredient match, then others.

3) UI polish
- Show “No results” state with suggestions.
- Add a clear X button to reset search.

E) Documentation
- Update README with:
  - how batch image generation works
  - how to set Cloudinary secrets (recommended for production)
  - how aspect ratio is enforced
  - how search works

Do all changes without breaking existing flows. Restart the app after changes.
