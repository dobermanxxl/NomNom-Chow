Implement a high-converting Amazon affiliate system across Nom Nom Chow (kids-only, parent-trust tone). Do NOT mention AI anywhere in the UI.

GOALS:
- Increase Amazon affiliate clicks and purchases without feeling spammy
- Make tools highly visible (“in the forefront”) in a helpful, parent-first way
- Add two evergreen curated bundles:
  1) Starter Kitchen for Parents
  2) Kid Chef Starter Kit (kid-safe tools)

A) Affiliate foundation (safe + compliant)
1) Use AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG env var to build Amazon links.
- If item has an ASIN, create a direct product URL with tag.
- If no ASIN, use Amazon search URL with the tag:
  https://www.amazon.com/s?k=<encodedQuery>&tag=<tag>
2) Add rel attributes for affiliate links: rel="nofollow sponsored noopener noreferrer"
3) Add a subtle sitewide disclosure in footer and on the Tools pages:
  "As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases."

B) High-conversion placement (do this exactly)
1) On EVERY meal detail page, place a “Helpful Tools for This Meal” module ABOVE the cooking steps (above the fold on mobile).
2) The module must be OPEN by default (not collapsed).
3) Use a conversion-optimized layout:
- 1 “Top Pick” hero card (largest, strongest CTA)
- 3–6 supporting tools below in a compact grid
- Each item must have:
  - short parent-focused benefit line (“Saves cleanup”, “No guessing chicken temp”, “Makes smashburgers easy”)
  - a single CTA button: “View on Amazon”
- Do NOT show prices, do NOT show star ratings, do NOT show giant product grids.

4) Also add the same module to the Weekly Meal Plan results page:
- Show “Tools that help this week” (bundle tools used across multiple meals)
- Cap to 6 items, focusing on cross-meal utility.

C) Starter Kitchen pages (evergreen, huge conversion drivers)
Add a new top-level nav item: “Starter Kitchen”
Create a page /starter-kitchen with two sections:

1) Starter Kitchen for Parents (8–12 items)
Curate essentials that parents actually buy, with kid-meal relevance:
- instant-read thermometer (ThermoPop/Thermapen alternative)
- large nonstick skillet
- sheet pan set
- silicone spatula set
- chef’s knife (mid-range) + knife sharpener
- cutting boards (color-coded or dishwasher-safe)
- mixing bowls set
- measuring cups/spoons
- air fryer liners or parchment
- food storage containers (meal prep)

2) Kid Chef Starter Kit (8–12 items)
Curate kid-safe, parent-approved items:
- kid-safe nylon/plastic knife set (e.g., Montessori knives)
- crinkle cutter
- kid apron set
- child-safe peelers
- small cutting board for kids
- mixing set for kids (bowls/whisks)
- mini rolling pin
- cookie cutters
- small step stool (kitchen helper)
- reusable squeeze bottles (sauces)
Make each item’s copy emphasize safety + participation + fun.

Each bundle page must:
- Show a short intro paragraph (trust-building, not sales)
- Show cards with image placeholder (optional), title, 1 benefit line, and “View on Amazon”
- Include “Why this helps busy parents” section
- Include FAQ: “Do I need all this?” (answer: no, start with top 3)

D) Data + admin controls
1) Add a simple JSON/DB-backed “Affiliate Catalog” so tools are reusable across meals and pages.
Each catalog item:
- id, title, category, searchQuery, asin (optional), benefit, tags (e.g. picky-eater, gluten-free cooking, air-fryer)
2) Add Admin UI:
- Manage Affiliate Catalog items
- Select:
  - default “Top Picks” (sitewide)
  - per-meal overrides (optional)
- If no per-meal overrides exist, auto-select tools based on meal attributes (e.g., burgers => burger press/spatula/thermometer; sheet-pan => sheet pan + parchment; pasta => pot + strainer).
3) Track click events (internal analytics table):
- toolId, mealId (optional), page (meal/starter-kitchen/plan), timestamp
No personal data required.

E) Copy + tone (no “AI”)
- Never say “recommended by AI” or “generated”
- Use language like:
  “Helpful if you want dinner done fast.”
  “Parents use this to avoid guessing.”
  “Optional—but makes cleanup easier.”
- Make CTAs consistent: “View on Amazon”

F) SEO (optimize always)
1) Add SEO titles/descriptions for:
- /starter-kitchen
- /starter-kitchen/parents
- /starter-kitchen/kid-chef
Use keywords naturally:
“kid-friendly cooking tools”, “kitchen essentials for parents”, “kid safe knives”, “kids cooking starter kit”
2) Add internal links from:
- home page
- meal pages (small link: “Build your starter kitchen”)
- plan page (small link: “Tools that help this week”)

G) UI: keep tools “in the forefront” without looking spammy
- Meal detail page layout order:
  1) Title + image
  2) Quick stats (time, skill, picky-eater-approved, gluten-free)
  3) Ingredients list + “Add to Shopping List”
  4) Helpful Tools module (open)
  5) Cooking steps
- Weekly plan page:
  - At top: “This week’s plan”
  - Immediately below: “Tools that help this week” module

Implementation notes:
- Use the existing React/Next (or current stack) components and styling system.
- Ensure mobile-first layout and fast load (lazy load any images).
- Do not break existing meal flows.
- After implementing, restart and republish.
