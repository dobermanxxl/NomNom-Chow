Upgrade Nom Nom Chow to be SEO-optimized, monetize-ready, and add meal planning. Also bulk-add meals with proper tags and images.

A) Data model upgrades (Prisma + DB)
1) Add/ensure fields on Meal:
- seoTitle (string)
- seoDescription (string)
- slug (unique string)
- tags (string[])  // include "picky-eater-approved", "gluten-free", etc.
- dietaryFlags (string[]) // e.g. ["gluten-free", "dairy-free"]
- amazonRecommendations (JSON or array) containing:
  - title
  - category (knife, cutting board, thermometer, air fryer, skillet, etc.)
  - asin (optional)
  - searchQuery (string)
  - affiliateUrl (string or computed)
  - whyThisHelps (string)
- imageUrl (string)
- cuisine, skillLevel, cookTime, ingredients, description (existing)

2) Add MealPlan model:
- id
- weekStartDate
- days (JSON) containing 7 entries with:
  - dayName
  - mealId
- createdAt

B) SEO (always-on)
1) Meal slugs:
- Generate a clean slug from title (kid-friendly-smashburger)
- Ensure uniqueness (append -2 etc.)
2) Page metadata:
- Home page: title, meta description optimized for "kids dinner ideas", "picky eater meals", "weeknight dinners"
- Meal detail page: use seoTitle + seoDescription and OpenGraph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image)
- Add canonical URLs using the slug
3) Structured data:
- Add JSON-LD schema.org Recipe markup on meal detail pages:
  - name, description, image, totalTime, recipeIngredient, recipeInstructions (if available), keywords/tags
4) Internal linking:
- On meal pages, show "Related Meals" links based on cuisine/tags.
5) Performance:
- Ensure images are lazy-loaded and sized correctly.

C) Monetization (Amazon affiliate + Instacart-ready)
1) Amazon affiliate:
- Add a “Recommended Tools & Ingredients” section on each meal page.
- Use AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG env var.
- If ASIN is not available, build an Amazon search URL using searchQuery:
  https://www.amazon.com/s?k=<encodedQuery>&tag=<AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG>
- Include 3–6 items per recipe (thermometer, skillet, sheet pan, kid knives, etc.) appropriate to the meal.
- Add a small disclosure: "As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases."
2) Instacart placeholder:
- Add a “Send Shopping List to Instacart” button (placeholder integration).
- For now, build a shareable shopping list page with copy-to-clipboard and “Open Instacart” link.

D) Weekly Meal Plan Generator
1) Create a new page: /plan
- User selects preferences:
  - picky eater friendly (toggle)
  - gluten-free (toggle)
  - cuisine preferences
  - max cook time
- Generate a 7-day plan using meals in DB that match filters.
- Show each day’s meal card with image.
- Create a combined shopping list for the week (dedupe ingredients).
- Allow “Regenerate day” or “Swap meal” per day.
- Save plans to MealPlan table (optional)
2) Add a CTA on home page: “Generate this week’s plan”

E) Bulk add meals + images (curated, kid-friendly)
1) Add 30 NEW meals (no duplicates) across:
- Smashburgers + American kid favorites
- Italian (pasta, meatballs, baked dishes)
- Asian-inspired (VERY mild, no spice)
- Salmon/fish (simple)
- Noodles (kid-safe)
2) Tagging rules:
- Add "picky-eater-approved" tag ONLY when the meal is truly simple, familiar flavors, minimal mixed textures.
- Add gluten-free meals and/or dietaryFlags where valid (use GF substitutes explicitly, e.g. tamari instead of soy sauce, GF pasta, corn tortillas).
- Ensure at least 6 meals are truly gluten-free.
3) SEO rules per meal:
- Title should be searchable (“Kid-Friendly Smashburgers”, “Easy Chicken Alfredo for Kids”)
- seoTitle should include a primary keyword ("kid-friendly", "easy weeknight", etc.) but still sound natural.
- seoDescription should be 140–160 chars, parent-focused, include 1–2 keywords.
- Slug generated automatically from title.
4) Images:
- For each new meal, auto-generate one photorealistic home-cooked kid-friendly image.
- 1024x1024 square.
- Upload to Cloudinary and store secure_url in imageUrl.
- IMPORTANT: Placeholder images should count as missing; generate real images for any placeholders too.

F) Admin improvements
1) Admin -> Meals:
- Show tags, dietary flags, and an “SEO status” indicator.
2) Admin -> Images:
- “Generate missing images” should include placeholder images.
3) Admin -> Plans:
- Allow viewing saved meal plans (optional).

Apply all changes, run migrations, seed meals, generate images (throttled), then restart and republish.
