Add automatic AI image generation for each meal (kids-only, home-cooked style) and store the result on the meal so images are never regenerated unless explicitly requested.

Requirements:
1) Admin-only generation:
- Only accessible from /admin (protected by ADMIN_PASSWORD).
- Public users must NOT trigger image generation.

2) UI changes:
- In /admin meal create/edit form, add:
  - A checkbox toggle: "Auto-generate image if missing" (default ON)
  - A button: "Generate Image Now" (manual trigger)
  - Show a preview thumbnail once generated.

3) When saving a meal:
- If imageUrl is empty and toggle is ON, automatically generate an image and set imageUrl.
- If imageUrl already exists, do nothing.

4) Image generation:
- Use OpenAI Images API server-side only.
- Prompt MUST be blanket-style and inferred automatically from the meal title + ingredients:
  - Photorealistic, natural kitchen lighting
  - Home-cooked weeknight meal
  - Kid-friendly, normal portions
  - No restaurant plating, no garnish, no studio lighting
  - Must match the dish accurately based on title + ingredients
- Do not hallucinate extra foods; must depict the actual meal.

5) Storage:
- Prefer Cloudinary upload if Cloudinary env vars exist:
  - CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
  - Upload the generated image and store the returned secure URL into meal.imageUrl
- If Cloudinary env vars are NOT set, fallback to saving the image locally:
  - Save to /public/generated/meals/<mealId>.png (or jpg)
  - Set imageUrl to that local path.

6) Rate limiting:
- Add a simple per-IP and per-admin-session rate limit to image generation (e.g., 10 per hour) with friendly error message.

7) Prisma/data:
- Ensure Meal has imageUrl field.
- Add meal stats increment for image generations (optional).
- Never store OpenAI keys client-side.

8) Provide:
- API route(s) like /api/admin/generate-meal-image
- Utility modules for prompt construction and Cloudinary/local storage
- Update README with setup steps and required secrets.
